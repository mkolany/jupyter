      "Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder in which people may experience fear and frequently refrain from getting into a situation that can make them feel trapped, embarrassed or helpless. Some agoraphobics are fearful of open spaces. Some even in a medical emergency, refuse to leave their homes because stepping outside their comfort zone is overwhelming. An agoraphobic also breaks out in a sweat while standing in a queue or being in a crowd. Most people who have agoraphobia avoid the place where deep emotional distress is likely to occur; they feel that they need a chum to accompany them to any public places.\n",

      "\n",
      "A number of physical and environmental factors can trigger agoraphobia and other phobias. For instance, they have been linked to a biochemical imbalance, mainly related to certain neurotransmitters in the brain. In a given situation, people with panic attack may begin to associate a mounting dismay with the situation and learn to avoid it.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to some theories, unresolved emotional conflicts can result in immense irritation. That is why physicians ought to make sure that the symptoms are not related to some other underlying medical conditions. Agoraphobia treatment usually consists of both medication and psychotherapy that can help you get rid of anxiety attacks. The patient can be exposed gradually to the situation that usually brings about fear with the help of breathing or relaxation techniques.\n",

      "„As a recovered agoraphobic, I can say that a few years ago I felt as though somebody put a curse on me. My therapist helped me to achieve and maintain a sense of calm.

      "You may have heard that a cup of aromatic tea is a crucial part of everyday life for the British. The majority of citizens in the UK admit that this national drink is so essential to their routine that it is hard to imagine life without a sip of freshly brewed tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Britons have been one of the world’s greatest tea consumers for nearly 400 years. According to historians, it was the Portuguese princess Catherine of Braganza that brought tea-drinking to the English royal court. Initially, the beverage was cherished among the aristocracy, but the trend soon spread beyond affluent elite circles to the middle classes and eventually even the poor could savour the delights of tea. The idea of five o’clock tea originated in 1840s when the wife of the seventh Duke of Bedford began inviting her friends to have nothing more than idle tittle-tattle. That elaborate social occasion quickly became widespread and thousands of the British fell in love with different types of tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "These days, it is estimated that 165 million cups are drunk in the United Kingdom every day. Of course, the British have their own customs for preparing tea. For some people the fact that 98% of Britons take milk with tea is a no-brainer. Apart from mild taste, there are significant benefits of drinking tea as well. It is a good source of vitamins (B1, B6, B9) and minerals such as potassium and manganese. Black tea, for instance, contains antioxidants that can help you prevent some types of cancer, lower risk of heart attack and strokes. Those of you who take pleasure in green tea are less likely to suffer from depression and chronic headaches. So what are you waiting for? Take a break and escape from the hubbub of your daily life.\n",

      "Delayed Flight Equals Pizza B1+\n",
      "That’s a brilliant story which involves a detoured flight, a benevolent pilot and a number of hungry passengers. The Frontier Airlines flight was heading for Denver when fierce weather forced the plane to land in Cheyenne. As a result, 157 passengers’ plans were suddenly thwarted and they found themselves stranded on the runway for nearly two hours. Anyone who has ever experienced a delayed flight knows that time drags when you’re waiting and it’s accompanied by a mounting sense of hunger.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food on board quickly ran out and the people’s nerves were frayed. Gerhard Brander, an airplane pilot who works for the FA, felt very uneasy about his ravenous passengers, so he made a noble call to Domino’s Pizza. Subsequently, he announced „Ladies and gentleman, Frontier Airlines is known for being one of the cheapest airlines in the US, but your captain is not cheap. I just ordered pizza for the entire plane.” It was disclosed that everyone erupted in thunderous applause on hearing the good news. The pilot paid for the take-away out of his own pocket and Grander was reportedly reluctant to accept any reimbursement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The airline’s spokesperson said that „this isn’t the first time one of our pilots has gone above and beyond to provide care for our customers.” Not only did she praise the pilot’s deed, but also emphasized the fact that other pilots also deserve recognition for their hard work.\n",

Every year we are bombarded with diversified visions of the future and whether to believe tech specialists or not some daring predictions are likely to become commonplace quite soon. Skyscanner, a website which provides price comparisons for hotels, car hire services and flights, has released a bold report titled „The Future of Travel in 2024.” They hypothesize what travel may look like in a decade from nowadays.\n",
      "\n",
      "This notable travel search engine predicts that space tourism will not be reserved exclusively for affluent and haughty holidaymakers. According to Skyscanner „orbital space travel will be the next hot ticket and commercial companies are lining up to make it a more affordable proposition.” Thrill-seeking travellers’ appetite should be appeased due to a new space race. Undoubtedly, government-funded efforts as well as commercial ventures will enable cosmic tourists to set foot on the lunar surface by 2024. Those unable to splash out $250,000 on a round-trip ticket, will console themselves with floating weightlessly in low Earth orbit at a competitive price.\n",

      "Visionaries look forward to other travel options as well. Hence, they went a bit further and said that travel from Sydney to London would take nearly two hours without multiple layovers. Skyscanner CEO Gareth Williams eagerly foresees the rise of hotels beneath the waves. „I suspect that mass underwater exploration and tourism will develop with greater pace than mass space tourism. And I suspect you would get more from it, because there is more to see down there than in space.” I hope they are not lost in their own daydreams.\n",

      "Wardrobing, the act of buying various items from a retail shop, using them once and then returning these products for a refund. This sneaky way to stay stylish has been on the rise for a while and stores appear to be powerless when it comes to this type of fraud. Instead of purchasing particular goods, wardrobers turn upmarket chains of department stores into their private libraries. The money-saving scam is usually done with costly garments, but recently the practice has also been common with computers, electronics as well as other devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly 70 per cent of American retailers admitted they have been victims of unscrupulous buyers. As a result, the retail industry loses over $8 billion a year. The question arises: is that a theft? Anita Naik from  in her research reveals that „over a quarter of women who admit to wardrobing feel guilty about it, but the pressure to look good on special occasions makes it feel like the only option for some to look good on a budget.” As mentioned above, there are some ethical issues involved. It goes without saying that wardrobers do not bear any costs and the purchased items, which are taken back to the shop, are less valuable. The majority of shady clients, who do not realize it’s an illegal process, make others pay higher prices on goods. I used to know one girl who was particularly fond of such illicit practices, but since the truth came out we have lost touch. Did she make friends with a better companion for shopping ventures? I guess I will never find out.\n",

They knew Silas was a strange man, and they were a little afraid of him. He was a mysterious person for the villagers. He lived alone and had very little contact with other villagers. He went to work and came back home. He never invited people to his house, and he never went out to meet the other men from the village. There was another reason why the villagers were afraid. When Silas was angry, he looked at people in such a way that they felt frightened and uneasy.\n",

      "One day the noise coming from the house attracted the attention of some village boys. They came close to Silas’s house and stood there listening. When Silas saw them, he opened the door and, without a word, he fixed his large brown eyes on the boys. He looked hard at them because he could not see very well. But the boys did not know this. They ran away in fear.\n",

      "Silas was not interested in the village people. He was only interested in his work. He worked all day and far into the night. In this way he didn’t think about his past. He hated the past. And the troubles from the past hurt him less when he worked. Because he worked so hard, he earned a lot of money. There was no one else who could do his job in Raveloe, and people paid for his work in gold and silver coins. He spent little on himself, but he got more and more interested in gold and silver. Every night he took the coins out and counted them. He loved their shape and colour and their shining faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "He kept them in a metal box under his bed. He took some stones out of the floor and made a hole. Each night, after counting the coins, he returned the box to the hole. Then he put the stones back, and covered them with sand from the garden. He wasn’t afraid of thieves, he just wanted to have the money close at hand. He couldn’t imagine putting it in a bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Year after year Silas worked and filled the metal box with coins. He still lived alone in the same house. Hard work changed the shape of his back, his arms and legs. He could not stand up straight any more. He was not yet forty years old, but his face was already dry and yellow like an old man’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifteen years passed. It is a long time, but Silas Marner’s life showed little change. At night he closed his doors and took out his money. Just looking at it made him happy. Because the metal box was too small to hold it all, he put the money into two bags. In both bags there was more gold than silver. He spent some small silver coins on his own needs. He often pushed his hands through the coins and counted them. ‘And others are on their way,’ he used to say to himself.\n",

      "CARNIVAL SAFETY SUCCESS\n",
      "\n",
      "This year’s Notting Hill Carnival, Europe’s biggest street festival, was the best ever. Despite the cloudy skies, the carnival brought the streets to life in its own unique way with record numbers and little reported crime. After the two murders in 2009, there had been major safety worries concerning this year’s carnival. To deal with these fears several changes were made. Firstly, the route for the carnival was changed to avoid the narrowest streets in Notting Hill, a residential area with many small roads. Secondly, the carnival organisers provided more stewards and they received better training. Finally, the organisers ensured that the ending time, 9 p.m., was closely observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following these changes, Carnival 2010 saw more than a million people party in the streets of Notting Hill. More than 3,000 people dressed in spectacular colourful costumes and paraded and danced through the streets, crowds of four and five people deep lined the route to try and see the event. Residents partied on apartment balconies and even the police took part. Apart from the carnival parade, the local area was filled with sound systems pumping out music of all different kinds – Samba, Reggae and Rap music being the most common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Police yesterday said that 56 arrests were made over the weekend, which included 30 arrests for pick-pocketing and three for robbery. The chairman of the Notting Hill Carnival Trust, Chris Mullard, yesterday said, “The criticism of the event has been ill-founded and I hope people will now see the carnival for what it is; a wonderful opportunity to project the multiculturalism that is metropolitan London.”\n",

      "The biography of Nelson Mandela reads like a morality tale. Here is a man who is subjected by a racist society to years of imprisonment, for most of the time in degrading and humiliating conditions, who emerges a quarter of a century later to become president of his country and Nobel Peace Prize winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nelson Mandela came slowly to political activism. He grew up as a reasonably privileged child and was not exposed to the racial discrimination which was becoming institutionalized in his country until he was at university at the age of 24. But once he recognized the injustices, he could not remain silent and he was expelled from the University of Fort Hare in 1940 for taking part in a student demonstration. He did not give up on his university degree, however, eventually completing the course by correspondence in 1942. He went on to become the first black student at the University of Witwatersrand, where he studied law, although he never completed the course.\n",
      "\n",
      "He joined the African National Congress (ANC) which was fighting for self-determination for a multi-racial society. But when the National Party (NP) came to power in South Africa in 1948, it introduced a policy of forced separation of races, which became known around the world as apartheid. By 1952 the ANC was encouraging protesters to refuse to obey laws which aimed at segregating the races in everyday life. However, Mandela urged the protesters not to use violence, even if violence was used against them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mandela did not just protest on the streets. With his friend, Oliver Tambo, he opened a law practice in Johannesburg, and continued to work there through his five-year long treason trial which the authorities staged as the ANC became more militant in the face of harsher and harsher racist laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1961 Mandela was recognized not guilty but he realized his life had changed. He went underground and even accepted the need for violent protests, after the massacre of 69 blacks in Sharpeville.\n",
      "\n",
      "The military arm of the ANC, the Umkhonto we Sizwe or Spear of the Nation was formed and Mandela went to Algeria for military training. On his return to South Africa, he was arrested in August 1962 and sentenced to five years in prison but then, following the arrest of ANC colleagues at Rivonia, he was tried again for treason and conspiracy and sentenced to life imprisonment in June 1964.\n",
      "\n",
      "He spent 18 years on the infamous Robben Island but he never lost touch with the outside world. His autobiography was written at this time and secretly sent out of prison, to be published later under the title Long Walk to Freedom. Mandela was moved to Pollsmoor Prison near Cape Town and finally to Victor Vester prison. By now, Mandela had become the icon for resistance to apartheid and finally, bowing to international and domestic pressure, the South African government lifted  the ban on the ANC and released Mandela in February 1990.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1993 Mandela and the President of South Africa, De Klerk, won the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to resolve the conflict between races, and in 1994 Mandela became the new President.\n",

      "There had been a christening that afternoon at St. Peter’s, and Albert Foreman still wore his verger’s gown. He busied himself quietly and waited for the vicar to finish in the vestry. Presently he saw him walk across the chancel. The vicar had been but recently appointed, ared-faced energetic man in the early forties, and Albert Foreman still missed his predecessor, a clergyman of the old school who preached leisurely sermons in a silvery voice and dined out a great deal with his more aristocratic parishioners. He liked things in church to be just so, but he never fussed; not like this new man who wanted to have his finger in every pie. But Albert Foreman was tolerant. The new vicar had come from the East End and he couldn’t be expected to fall in at once with the discreet ways of his fashionable congregation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A most extraordinary circumstance came to my knowledge the other day,” said the vicar. “Idiscovered to my astonishment that you could neither read nor write, Foreman. That situation is impossible at a church like St. Peter’s. I’m afraid you must go.”\n",
      "“Yes sir, I quite understand. I shall be happy to hand in my resignation as soon as you’ve found somebody to take my place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But when Albert Foreman with his usual politeness had closed the church door behind the vicar he could not sustain the air of unruffled dignity with which he had borne the blow inflicted upon him and his lips quivered. His heart was heavy. He didn’t know what he should do with himself. Albert Foreman was a non-smoker, but with a certain latitude. It occurred to him now that a cigarette would comfort him. He looked about him for a shop where he could buy a packet of Gold Flakes. It was a long street with all sorts of shops, but there was not a single one where you could buy cigarettes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t be the only man who walks along this street and wants a fag,” he said. “I shouldn’t wonder but what a fellow might do very well with a little shop here. Tobacco and sweets.”\n",
      "He gave a sudden start.\n",
      "“That’s an idea,” he said. “Strange how things come to you when you least expect it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day he found a little shop to let that looked perfect. He set up in business as a tobacconist and newsagent. His wife said it was a dreadful come-down after being verger of St. Peter’s, but he answered that you had to move with the times. In the course of ten years he had acquired no less than ten shops and was making money hand over fist. He went round to all of them himself every Monday, collected the week’s takings and took them to the bank. One morning he was shown into the manager’s office.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Foreman, I wanted to have a talk to you about the money you’ve got on deposit with us. Apart from what you paid in this morning it’s a little over thirty thousand pounds. That’s a large sum to have on deposit and I should have thought you’d better invest it. We’ll make you out a list of absolutely gilt-edged securities. All you’ll have to do next time you come in is just to sign the transfers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could do that all right, but how should I know what I was signing?” said Albert. “I suppose you can read,” said the manager a trifle sharply.\n",
      "Mr. Foreman gave him a disarming smile.\n",
      "“Well, sir, that’s just it. I can’t. I know it sounds funny-like but I can’t read or write.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manager stared at him as though he were a prehistoric monster.\n",
      "“And do you mean to say that you’ve built up this important business without being able to read or write? Good God, man, what would you be now if you had been able to?”\n",
      "“I can tell you that sir,” said Mr. Foreman. “I’d be verger of St. Peter’s, Neville Square.”\n",

      "It has been my habit for many years to take a nap after lunch. I settle myself in a chair in the living-room with a cushion behind my head, and I read until I drop off. On that day, I was in my chair and feeling as comfortable as ever when my wife, who has never been a silent lady, began to talk to me. “These two people, the Snaps” she said, “what time are they coming?” I made no answer, so she repeated the question, louder, this time. I told her politely that I didn’t know.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve met them only once, I don’t think I like them very much,” she said. “Especially him. A dreadful man, really. Never stops telling jokes, or stories, or something. And she is pretty frightful, too. When do you think they will arrive?”\n",
      "“Somewhere around six o’clock, I guess. I’m sure you’ll manage them very well, dear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But don’t you think they are awful?” she asked. “They are too awful, they really are. It’s too late to put the meeting off.”\n",
      "“Then why did you ask them?” The question slipped out before I could stop myself and I regretted it at once, for it is a rule with me never to provoke my wife if I can help it. “You know very well why I asked them,” she answered sharply. “For bridge, that’s all. They play an absolutely first-class game, and for a reasonable sum.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The only time I met them I must say they did seem quite nice.”\n",
      "“Arthur!” she called. “I’ve just had a marvelous idea. Now, listen. I was thinking how awful they really are…the way they behave…him with his jokes and her…Well, if that’s the way they behave when they are in front of us, then what must they be like when they’re alone together? All we’ve got to do is put a microphone in their room.”\n",
      "I admit I was expecting something pretty bad, but when she said this, I didn’t know how to answer. “Here!” I cried. ”You can’t do that. That’s about the nastiest trick I’ve ever heard of. You don’t mean it seriously, do you?” I knew how much she disliked being contradicted, but there were times when I felt it necessary to assert myself. “Pamela,” I said sharply, “I forbid you to do it!”\n",
      "“But listen, Arthur. I’m a nasty person. And so are you – in a secret sort of way. It’s just as right as when you found those letters of Mary Probert’s in her purse and you read them through from the beginning to the end. That’s why we get along together.”\n",
